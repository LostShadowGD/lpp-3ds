**âš  This is a fork of the original lpp-3ds, with preserved and reformatted documentation, as the original project is no longer actively maintained.**
The latest build I know of is from 28th Feb 2016, and the docs mention last being updated on the 15th July 2016, at 11:25 GMT +1:00. There are nightly builds from after that (as mentioned in the docs), yet they use Linkvertise links, which I always find to never work ever. I'm planning to contact Rinnegatamante for older nightly builds. Supposedly we have newer builds, but again: Linkvertise.

**--- The original README.md continues from here. ---**

# Description

# Compiling the source

The repository will provide you a full set of all of the needed libraries. Take in mind that a lot of them are modified versions of the original ones so if you want to update them, take a look at [this repository](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-3ds_libraries) where you can find sourcecodes of every pre-builded library used in this repository. Also take in mind that **libkhax** includes also **libSu** sourcecode. Last but not least, please note that **libjpeg.a** file is a standard compilation of libjpeg-turbo.<br><br>
Lua Player Plus 3DS supports different flags to enables some features:<br>
**-DUSE_MEMCHUNKHAX2** enables memchunkhax2 usage through svchax at startup for firmwares between 9.3 and 10.7.<br>
**-DCITRA3DS_COMPATIBLE** removes romFs support causing Citra3DS emulator crash.<br>
**-DSKIP_ERROR_HANDLING** disables error handling for faster code execution (this is used for Unsafe version).<br>
**-DFORCE_SD** forces interpreter to load main script from SD instead of romFs filesystem.<br>
**-DFORCE_DSP** forces interpreter to use dsp::DSP audio service even if csnd:SND is available.<br>
